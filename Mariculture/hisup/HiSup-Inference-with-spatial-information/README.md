# HiSup-Inference-with-spatial-information
This work is based on https://github.com/SarahwXU/HiSup. I added several blocks to enable creating prediction results with spatial information.Here you can use fine-tuned model from your own dataset. To run this Jupyter notebook, you need to preinstall the required packages as instructed by HiSup. Change the path for your own application.
